AS.440.601 Microeconomic Theory 
Assignment 1 
1.(5 pts)   Suppose that f(x,y)=xy. Find the   maximum   value   for   f   if   x   and y   are   constrained   to   sum   to   1. Solve this problem in two ways: by substitution and by using the Lagrange multiplier   method.
2.(5 pts) The dual problem to the one described in   question   1   is
Minimize                    x+y 
subject to                xy=0.25.Solve   this   problem   using   the   Lagrangian   technique.   Then   compare   the   value   you   get   for   the   Lagrange multiplier with the value you got in question   1. Explain the relationship between the two   solutions.
3.(10 pts) Each day Paul, who is in third grade,   eats lunch   at   school.   He   likes   only   Twinkies   (t)   and soda (s), and these provide him   a utility   of
utility=U(t,s)=√ts.
a.       (5 pts) If   Twinkies cost $0.10   each   and   soda   costs   $0.25 per   cup, how   should   Paul   spend the $1 his mother gives him to maximize   his utility?
b.       (5 pts) If   the school tries to discourage Twinkie consumption by   increasing   the price to $0.40, by how much will Paul’s mother have to increase his lunch allowance to provide   him   with   the   same   level   of   utility   he   received   in   part   (a)?
4.(20 pts) Two of   the simplest utility functions   are:
1.       (10 pts) Fixed   proportions:   U   (x,   y) = min[x,   y].
2.       (10 pts) Perfect substitutes:   U   (x,   y) = x   + y.

Demand functions for x and y 
Indirect utility function
Expenditure function
5.(30 pts) Consider   the   Cobb–Douglas   utility   function   U(x,   y) = x α y   1-α   , where   0≤α≤1. This problem   illustrates   a   few   more   attributes   of   that   function.
a.       (10 pts) Calculate the indirect utility function   for this   Cobb–Douglas   case.
b.       (10 pts) Calculate the expenditure function   for this   case.
c.       (10 pts)   Show explicitly how the compensation required to   offset the   effect   of   an   increase   in   the   price   of x is   related   to   the   size   of   the   exponent   α   .
6.(30 pts).   Suppose the utility function for goods x and y is   given by
utility   =   U   (x,   y)   =   xy   + y.
a.       (10 pts) Calculate the uncompensated (Marshallian) demand   functions   for   x   and y,   and
describe how the demand curves for x and y are   shifted by   changes   in   I   or the price   of   the   other good.
b.       (10 pts) Calculate the expenditure function   for x   and y.
c.       (10 pts) Use the expenditure function calculated   in part   (b)   to   compute   the   compensated   demand functions for goods x and y. Describe how the compensated   demand   curves for x and y are shifted by changes in income   or   by   changes   in   the price   of   the   other   good.
